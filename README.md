# OpenStack Basics for Mercury - KTOS-108

This is the bootcamp class lab guide. The guide is one of the three major parts of the OpenStack basics for Mercury class provided by Kumulus Technologies (KTOS-108).

There are class sections that describe the lab elements for each of the different class sections, and updates/changes will be provided on an as needed basis as they occur.

Lab sections will map up to sections in the class guide, and will be made available on learn.kumul.us.

Deploy a test OpenStack System if one hasn't been provided for you already.
 - VirtualBox or remote Virutal Machine
 - Leverage Docker/Kolla environment
 - use either the Vagrant script or leverage the ansible deployment "initialize.yml" script.

A useful Vagrant or "terraform" deployed OpenStack system is available at https://github.com/kumulustech/kolla-multinode
